# Product Requirements Document: Claude Code Flow Build Fix

## 1. Overview
The goal of this project is to fix the failing build of the `claude-code-flow` repository. The build is currently failing with over 700 TypeScript errors. This PRD outlines the tasks required to bring the build to a stable, error-free state, following the architectural principles and debugging strategies we have established.

## 2. High-Level Requirements
The primary requirement is to achieve a successful `npm run build` command execution with zero errors.

## 3. Functional Requirements
The project will be broken down into the following phases, which must be executed in order:

*   **Phase 1: Resolve Architectural Violations**
    *   **REQ-1.1:** The codebase must not contain any imports or dependencies on the `vscode` module. The file `src/terminal/vscode-bridge.ts` must be removed from the build process.
    *   **REQ-1.2:** The codebase must not contain any Deno-specific APIs or globals. A full audit must be performed to identify and remove any such code.

*   **Phase 2: Fix Configuration Errors**
    *   **REQ-2.1:** The `tsconfig.json` file must be reviewed and corrected. This includes ensuring `moduleResolution` is set correctly for Node.js, path aliases are properly configured, and compiler options align with project standards. The conflict between linter rules requiring `.ts` extensions and TypeScript configuration forbidding them must be permanently resolved.
    *   **REQ-2.2:** The `package.json` file must be audited for any missing, unused, or conflicting dependencies.

*   **Phase 3: Resolve Import/Module Resolution Errors**
    *   **REQ-3.1:** All TypeScript errors of the type "Cannot find module" (e.g., TS2307) must be resolved. This involves fixing import paths and ensuring all dependencies have their necessary type definitions installed.

*   **Phase 4: Fix Type-Checking Errors**
    *   **REQ-4.1:** Once all architectural, configuration, and import errors are fixed, all remaining TypeScript type-checking errors (e.g., `TS2339`, `TS2345`) must be systematically addressed until the build is clean.

## 4. Out of Scope
*   Adding new features.
*   Refactoring code that is not directly causing build errors.
*   Updating dependencies to new major versions unless required to fix a build error.
