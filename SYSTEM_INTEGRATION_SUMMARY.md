  - Strategy factory includes meta-framework workflows in available workflows list

### 2. Orchestration (`claude-flow orchestration`)
**Advanced multi-agent coordination and workflow management**

- **2 Core Frameworks**: MCP Orchestration DSL, Swarm Intelligence
- **Integration Points**:
  - Task engine supports complex workflow definitions from orchestration DSL
  - Swarm coordinator uses orchestration patterns for agent coordination
  - Workflow system integrates orchestration frameworks directly

### 3. Startup (`claude-flow startup`)
**Systematic capability activation and orientation protocols**

- **MetaClaude Protocol**: Comprehensive orientation with 6 core capabilities and 13 advanced tutorials
- **Integration Points**:
  - Swarm strategies leverage startup capabilities for agent initialization
  - Task engine uses startup protocols for system preparation
  - Memory management integration for capability state tracking

### 4. Synthesis (`claude-flow synthesis`)
**Intelligent knowledge synthesis and pattern discovery**

- **2 Core Systems**: Pattern Synthesizer, Meta-Learning Darwin GÃ¶del Machine
- **Integration Points**:
  - Swarm coordinator uses synthesis for pattern-based task decomposition
  - Workflow system leverages synthesis for pattern-driven workflow creation
  - Task engine integrates synthesis for intelligent task analysis

## ðŸ”— System Integration Architecture

### Enhanced Swarm Coordinator Integration
```typescript
// src/swarm/enhanced-coordinator.ts

- Integrates with all 7 swarm strategies (auto, development, research, analysis, testing, optimization, maintenance)
- References meta-frameworks, orchestration, synthesis, and startup workflows
- Hierarchical model configuration with AI-powered task decomposition
```

### Strategy Factory Integration
```typescript
// src/swarm/strategy-factory.ts
- 7 comprehensive strategies with full workflow integration

```

### Task Engine Integration
```typescript
// src/task/engine.ts
- Comprehensive workflow support with dependency management
- Resource allocation and scheduling
- Checkpoint and rollback systems
- Integration with Memory for persistence
```

### Workflow System Integration
```typescript
// src/cli/commands/workflow.ts
- Direct integration with meta-frameworks and orchestration
- Workflow catalog with complexity and time estimates
- Category-based organization (meta-frameworks, orchestration, synthesis)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration Patterns

### 1. **TodoWrite/TodoRead Coordination**
