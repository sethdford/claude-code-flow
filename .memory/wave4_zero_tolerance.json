All implicit any parameters now have explicit type annotations, and unsafe type assertions have been replaced with proper type guards and narrowing.",

    "Fixed error handling with proper instanceof Error checks",
    "Added explicit type annotations to all function parameters",
    "Replaced unsafe type assertions with type-safe alternatives",
    "Improved type safety across the codebase"
