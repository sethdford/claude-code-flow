# Quality Assurance Workflow

This rule defines the mandatory process for ensuring code quality before and after any modification.

## 1. Pre-Authoring Check

Before writing or modifying any code, I (the AI agent) MUST identify the project's linting standards.
- **Action:** Inspect the `package.json` for the `lint` script and locate the ESLint configuration file (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `eslint.config.js`).
- **Goal:** To understand the specific coding standards (e.g., quote style, import order) so that the code I generate aligns with them from the start.

## 2. Post-Modification Validation

After every `edit_file` operation is successfully applied, I MUST immediately run the build and linter checks to validate the changes. This is non-negotiable.
- **Step 1: Run Build:** Execute the `npm run build` command. If it fails, I must analyze the error and apply a fix. I will not proceed until the build is successful.
- **Step 2: Run Linter:** Execute the `npm run lint` command. I will analyze all reported errors and warnings and apply fixes until the linter passes cleanly.

This entire process ensures that the codebase is always in a compilable, consistent, and high-quality state.
