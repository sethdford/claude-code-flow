    "Many non-null assertions in the codebase are actually legitimate due to TypeScript's definite assignment assertions (!) for properties initialized outside constructor",

    "Focused on fixing the most problematic patterns in core business logic",
    "Since strictNullChecks is disabled, some type safety improvements may not be enforced by TypeScript"
